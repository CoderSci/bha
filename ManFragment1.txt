
Man: Fragments of a Forgotten History 
by "Two Chel√¢s" in the Theosophical Society 

 
INTRODUCTION 
The present writers are bound to disclaim all pretence of having delineated more than the broad features of the subjects treated of in these pages. They are aware, however,that the world, at this late day, expects so little truth about the origin and infancy of man that it extends but a grudging consideration to anything beyond the vaguest surmises and the most shadowy outlines; and is always ready to condemn, what it would call, the credulous temerity of an individual, who ventures accurately to survey regions of investigation which it pronounces inexplorable 
The small band of esoteric teachers, the inheritors of the secret knowledge of the ages, have till lately found silence to be the only means for its preservation. But the time has arrived for the world to receive a portion of their accumulated wealth. The choice, however, of the present method, so different from all preconceived ideas of the fitness of things, is sure to give rise to feelings of a very varied character. The question would naturally suggest itself why the discovery of ancient books and manuscripts, undeniably authentic and plainly historical, should not have been made the occasion for the revival of the forgotten lore, if the present generation is to be at all instructed in the story of the origin and infancy of its ancestors. The allegorical character, however,of ancient writings which renders them unintelligible to all but the initiated reader, prevents such a course being adopted: hence the necessity of the present plan. 
It is herein attempted to show mankind of today what man was ages before those usually reckoned as the era of his first appearance on earth; and the early conditions of the race and its progressive growth will be found to teem with interest and instruction even in the meager account that follows. 
It will, perhaps, be asked - What is the source of information, who are the Teachers? They are the sages of the East, the inheritors of the knowledge of the Magian, the Chaldean, the Egyptian, and the ancient Rishis of India; from one of whom, a beloved and revered Master, known to many in the West as well as in the East, the present writers have received the instruction, part of which is presented to the world in the following pages. With the accuracy of the information here afforded, if not with its fulness, the writers are satisfied, and they give it with the sincere hope that the world, for its own enlightenment, will extent to it an open-minded and wise consideration,notwithstanding the imperfections which the shortcomings of the writers may have produced. 
The writers were perfect strangers to each other until they met last spring,and the circumstances which brought them together will be found narrated in the following prefaces. The mystical student of psychology, who knows the inadequacy of a bare statement of facts for the presentation of psychic incidents,will hardly need an apology for the form in which the narratives are cast. 

 
PREFACE 
BY THE EASTERN CHELA 
The sun had sunk down behind the tall pines, the giant sentries guarding the little cottage that so snugly nestled on the bosom of the Himalayas; but the evening glow, the farewell blessing of the departing luminary, still lingered on the treetops. The little shepherd boy, who so faithfully preserves the secrecy of the lonely habitation from the cruel ears of he hunters whose midnight halloos frighten the yearling fawns and whose murderous weapons ever and again render them motherless, had just brought in tidings that a company of English officials were encamped at no great distance and might be expected next morning, to outrage once more the peaceful hillside with their unhallowed sport. As the slight figure of the adventurous youth, descending the perilous crag with the sure step of the Himalayan goat, the companion of his infancy, was hidden from view by the deepening shadows of night, and the last note of his rude pipe died away in the stillness of the scene, a weariness came over the meditative mystic student, the solitary dweller of that lonely cottage. 
He was not born to mysticism, but was drawn into it. His eyes first beheld the light among the bustle and stir of a populous city; his youthful steps had threaded crowded thoroughfares and his mind was instructed in many an old seat of learning. Time had left on him footprints which had burnt deep into his soul. But inquire not into the origin of the students of The Holy Lore, and let not the curious hand rake up the cold ashes from the funeral pyre of the past. It is enough to say that the slow dissolution of selfishness had pushed the mystic back, step by step, from the busy walks of daily life, the ever expanding circle of duty had caused the early bonds to burst and the narrow heart to break and scatter its fragments far and wide. Sustained by the traditions of his race and cheered by the sad benevolent smile of one, not to be profaned by mention here, the mystic student treads the uphill path of duty to his country and his kind, though not without occasional checks from despondency and sorrow, produced by spectacles of sin and pain. The increasing serenity of his life deepened the pity in his soul for others whose course diverged from his. O that man should be unhappy though his spirit is the very essence of bliss! But the Eternal Necessity works on its never-ending woof of progress through discord and imperfection. 
Roll on darks cycles of descent; our hands, though armed with the energy of self-sacrifice, clutch at the spokes of thy wheel in vain! To the last turn will that wheel revolve. We have only the privilege of pursuing our work in silent expectation of the day when thy resistless course will backward wind, but even now we have the glory of an unselfish death. O death, thou deep-veiled virgin, how few have seen the charms in thy face! How few are the worshippers on whom thy dark eyes have smiled! 
Ah, sweet is life,but sweeter still is death! 
How few comprehend death! None among that light-hearted and light-minded band of Englishmen whose campfires gleam in the darkness of the valley, like the lurid eyes of some cruel monster, knows the solemn majesty of death,whom they would as laughingly receive themselves as force upon others. 
The mystery of death is the greatest mystery of all. 

 
The past-searching eyes of yon Brahman, emerging from the Ganges' sacred waters, turn in mute appeal to the Gods of his fathers, at the sight of those ruined temples, raised by the pious hands of antiquity, and unbidden tears trickle down his cheeks as he mourns his country dead. Timid short-sighted man! Is India 
dead because she suckles children not her own? If thou could's place thyself on the crest of that proud mountain-wave thou wouldst see across the tracts of time the break of a dawn brighter and purer than these hills have yet beheld. Man! man is thy brother! Give to thy brother what he has not, and supply thy own deficiencies from what he offers thee. The right hand must aid the left, the East must united with the West; the young must join hands with the old; and the beauty of harmony will smile on the face of the Earth ..... 
Hark! what discordant scream disturbs the calm repose of the restful landscape? Sailing like a mass of darkness in the serene sea of moonlight, the Himalayan eagle startles the tremulous shades of night and wakens echoes from every glen and crag. But more piercing by far is the cry of despair borne by the western breeze from the unfortunate victims, naked and famishing among the crumbling ruins of Creed and Thought. The streams of sound swept by confused and indistinct; but the cries of the soul always wing their way to other souls, whose doors are not barred nor their casements closed. Loud above the rest was heard the clear voice of great hearts that knocks at the gates of self-crowned princes of thought, in vain attempt to raise an echo, and are thrown back upon the black rock of despair to wait for the ravenous jaws of the dragon of spiritual death. 
Amidst the psychic war of elements and the devouring earthquake of the mind, like a streak of silver light there flashed in the student's mind the voice of his master:- 
"Go, be true to thy pledge to manhood; westward lies thy path. Take this mutilated scroll, an unknown, though kindred spirit will bring the missing fragments, and then will be revealed to thee things which thou hast till now sought in vain. Take no thought for the morrow nor tarry here in a single day; thy path of duty leads to the West".... 
Far, far away in the New World, in the city of the rising sun there waited a solitary soul which seemed to have dropped from some other sphere and lost its way in a strange land. Its cry of help was heard and the words wrung form it by doubt and bewilderment were sped across long stretches of sea and land. 
The vision was downed in the tide of returning sense, but the ear caught the fading words, "Thy path of duty leads to the West." 
Obedient steps were bent westward and the faithful pupil found himself among the ill-fated splendour of Paris - Ah! Paris, Paris! thou must die that France may live! - France alone among her many enemies, and the worst of them thou! 
Ghostlike the ascetic haunted the homes of wealth and pleasure, everywhere regarded more as the mysterious hand that recorded the doom of the Assyrian monarch than a human being willing to work and bear. 

 
One evening among the gaieties of a Parisian salon, with all to charm the sense and sicken the soul, an airy tongue sellable his name: - 
"Come, come to my help!" 
The faraway voice downed the music and obscured the dancing shapes. The bright sallies of wit remained unheard, the gay companions unheeded. The two strangers met and were strangers no more, the fragments united together, the torn scroll became whole. 
The mystic scroll was all in quaint characters and in an unknown tongue. Many an anxious day and many a watchful night has it cost the fellow-students, united in a strange land, to decipher its meaning. The following pages represent the result  

 
PREFACE 
BY THE WESTERN CHELA 
The winds of a cheerless winter day had whirled and twirled snow-wreaths through the air until the world seemed wrapped in fleecy clouds. 
The space above and below man's feet was all white, all glistening with crystal flakes that multiplied themselves in endless forms and nestled on the earth like a gossamer pall. It was winter, and winter in a climate inhospitable and bitter even in its best aspects; winter in the north, where the bleak blasts were far too many and the warmth of summer tarried not long. This day there seemed to have been united the disagreeableness of many snowstorms, and the leaden look of the early dawn had justified the predictions of the weather-wise that there was likelihood of a strong blow from the polar regions. It came duly, and thick and fast, the pretty down kissed the cold earth and sank out of sight in its absorbing embrace. At first this was the case, but by-and-by the old mother weary of a repetition of such visits, returned them no more, and the little messengers gathered together on her breast, closely packing themselves, until she was entirely hidden from view and there was no more of her brown self visible to man, The world was decked in snow and he sky seemed never to weary of sifting it through space, and covering with its purity all the dark spots and uncanny lines of the city streets and byways. 
It was a day for meditation and dreams, a time for the restful to rest, the serene to find repose in their inner selves, safe from the interruptions of daily life without. For the contented, it was a day of peace and communion with better thoughts than could be invoked when the cares and the duties of the world interposed. 
And it was the opportunity for the soul to assert itself, and speak in no uncertain tones through the thick walls of sense which entirely deadened its voice many days at a time. 
In that vas city which the snow had claimed for its own, there was one soul which looked out through her slight casement upon the scenes of life, and rejoiced in the outward storm that gave such a prospect of inner calm. The tenement which enshrined that soul was slight indeed, and it trembled before the strength of the wind - as evidenced by the noise at the windows and about the entries. Gazing wistfully out upon the scene until giddiness caused the eyes to close and the heart to sigh in regret, thoughts of the hungry poor who were crowded in unwholesome habitations, of little children whose tender flesh was pinched and quivering, whose woes would be intensified by the presence of the visitant so beautiful to look upon, so hard to entertain unless greeted with warmth and cheer at the hearthstone,crowded the busy brain and caused the clasped hands to tighten in pain. Regrets which, worse than vain, are always weakening and distressing were not long harboured, for there was work for fingers and mind, and there were tasks unperformed awaiting attention. But whether it was the effects of the storm upon a highly strung nature or the sense of the helplessness that followed a realization of human suffering which could not be averted, the hands could not write, the brain refused to act and the passive mind lapsed into a reverie which seemed likely to deepen into slumber. It might have been a midday sleep, but it was not destined so to be. While yet the drooping eyelids hovered near together and the parted lips offered no impediment to the deep respiration of the half-reclining form, a mysterious something roused the dormant senses, and, as would a stroke of lightning, changed the recumbent position to one of upright, eager expectancy.
